This problem optimizes the berth allocation of a set of ships simultaneously in multiple ports while also considering the sailing speed of ships between ports. Due to the highly combinatorial character of the problem, exact methods struggle to scale to large-size instances, which points to exploring heuristic methods. We present a mixed-integer problem formulation for the MCBAP and introduce an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with a local search procedure to solve it. The computational results highlight the method's suitability for larger instances by providing high-quality solutions in short computational times. Practical insights indicate that the carriers' and terminal operators' operational costs are impacted in different ways by fuel prices, external ships at port, and the modeling of a continuous quay.","tags":[],"title":"An Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search Heuristic for The Multiport Continuous Berth Allocation Problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernardo Martin-Iradi","Kayla Cummings","Alexandre Jacquillat"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"3547dbadaa3feb1ac36e63b52f86c9d4","permalink":"https://martiniradi.github.io/publication/microtransit/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/microtransit/","section":"publication","summary":"Microtransit offers opportunities to enhance urban mobility by combining the reliability of public transit and the flexibility of ride-sharing. This paper optimizes the design and operations of a demand-responsive microtransit system that relies on reference lines and performs on-demand deviations in response to passenger demand. We formulate a Microtransit Network Design (MiND) model via two-stage stochastic optimization. The model features a tight second-stage formulation thanks to a subpath-based representation of microtransit operations in a load-expanded network, which optimizes on-demand deviations between checkpoint stops. We develop a double-decomposition algorithm combining Benders decomposition and subpath-based column generation armed with a tailored label-setting algorithm. Using real-world data from Manhattan, results suggest that our method scales to large practical instances, with up to 100 candidate lines and hundreds of stops. Comparisons with transit and ride-sharing benchmarks suggest that microtransit provides win-win outcomes toward efficient mobility (high demand coverage, low operating costs, high level of service), equitable mobility (broad geographic reach) and sustainable mobility (limited environmental footprint).","tags":[],"title":"Design and optimization of on-demand microtransit systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernardo Martin-Iradi","Dario Pacino","Stefan Ropke"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1643932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643932800,"objectID":"c8a29df9aecf404f9517d8ff5e66df10","permalink":"https://martiniradi.github.io/publication/ts2022/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ts2022/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a variant of the berth allocation problem—that is, the multiport berth allocation problem—aimed at assigning berthing times and positions to vessels in container terminals. This variant involves optimizing vessel travel speeds between multiple ports, thereby exploiting the potentials of a collaboration between carriers (shipping lines) and terminal operators. Using a graph representation of the problem, we reformulate an existing mixed-integer problem into a generalized set partitioning problem, in which each variable refers to a sequence of feasible berths in the ports that the vessel visits. By integrating column generation and cut separation in a branch-and-cut-and-price procedure, our proposed method is able to outperform commercial solvers in a set of benchmark instances and adapt better to larger instances. In addition, we apply cooperative game theory methods to efficiently distribute the savings resulting from a potential collaboration and show that both carriers and terminal operators would benefit from collaborating.","tags":[],"title":"The Multiport Berth Allocation Problem with Speed Optimization: Exact Methods and a Cooperative Game Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernardo Martin-Iradi","Stefan Ropke"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1619913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619913600,"objectID":"f371a28f3cf4917d1ff891538ee29da2","permalink":"https://martiniradi.github.io/publication/ejor22/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ejor22/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, the periodic train timetabling problem is formulated using a time-space graph formulation that exploits the properties of a symmetric timetable. Three solution methods are proposed and compared where solutions are built by what we define as a dive-and-cut-and-price procedure. An LP relaxed version of the problem with a subset of constraints is solved using column generation where each column corresponds to the train paths of a line. Violated constraints are added by separation and a heuristic process is applied to help to find integer solutions. The passenger travel time is computed based on a solution timetable and Benders’ optimality cuts are generated allowing the method to integrate the routing of the passengers. We propose two large neighborhood search methods where the solution is iteratively destroyed and repaired into a new one and one random iterative method. The problem is tested on the morning rush hour period of the Regional and InterCity train network of Zealand, Denmark. The solution approaches show robust performance in a variety of scenarios, being able to find good quality solutions in terms of travel time and path length relatively fast. The inclusion of the proposed Benders’ cuts provide stronger relaxations to the problem. In addition, the graph formulation covers different real-life constraints and has the potential to easily be extended to accommodate more constraints.","tags":[],"title":"A column-generation based matheuristic for periodic and symmetric train timetabling with integrated passenger routing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernardo Martin-Iradi","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
