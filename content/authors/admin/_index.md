I am a third year PhD student in Operations Research at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), advised by Prof. Dario Pacino and Prof. Stefan Ropke. 
<!-- Currently, I am conducting a research stay at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hosted by Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat.  -->
In my research, I develop decomposition-based methods for large-scale optimization applied to transportation and logistics. My current two projects involve collaborative maritime logistics and on-demand microtransit systems. 

<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks. -->
