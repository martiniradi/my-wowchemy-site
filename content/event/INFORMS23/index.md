# summary: An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: 'Demand-responsive microtransit defines a middle ground between public transit (reference route) and on-demand mobility (real-time routing adjustments). We formulate a two-stage stochastic program to optimize network design (in the first stage) and system operations (in the second stage). We propose an effective model representation based on time-space-load networks with subpath variables. We solve it via a tailored algorithm combining Benders decomposition and column generation. Results on real-world data indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline modeling and computational approaches, and that microtransit systems can provide win-win benefits compared to transit and ride-sharing systems â€”higher level of service, lower operating costs, and smaller environmental footprint.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
