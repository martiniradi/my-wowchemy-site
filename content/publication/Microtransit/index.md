abstract: On-demand microtransit defines a middle ground between public transit (with a reference route and a reference schedule) and on-demand transportation (with real-time routing adjustments to serve on-demand requests). We formulate a two-stage stochastic program to optimize strategic network design (in the first stage) along with system operations (in the second stage). We propose an effective model representation based on a time-space-load network. This structure enables the design of a tailored Benders decomposition algorithm. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline modeling and computational approaches, and that microtransit systems can provide win-win-win benefits in urban mobilityâ€”a higher level of service for passengers, lower operating costs for transit operators, and a smaller environmental footprint.
